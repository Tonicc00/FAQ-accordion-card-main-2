# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

### What I learned

I learned to use flexbox better (at least I think I did), some JS functionality and the positioning of HTML elements.
I can say I am proud of this project. My goal here was to implement JS in to the page, i.e. when the arrow is clicked i should show propper paragraph. Maybe I could have done it better but this works fine so I am satisfied.


### Continued development

In the future I would like to be able to better arrange elements for responsive design and maybe write a shorter and more compact functions.
